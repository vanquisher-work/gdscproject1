        <p>"I was diagnosed with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) at age 15. I had a difficult diagnosis journey, due the rarity of myasthenia, and had major surgery and therapies as part of my management plan. I still take daily medication to manage the symptoms. After sharing  diagnosis only with direct family members for almost 3 years, I am  now committed to raising awareness for my rare condition and the impacts it has on various parts of my life. I now study medicine and aspires to use my platform as both a medical student and MG warrior to raise awareness." </p>

          "Dunstan Nicol-Wilson is from London, England, and was diagnosed with the “invisible disorder” sickle cell anemia from birth. Nicol-Wilson has a BSc in bioscience and an MSc in public health (global health). He has spent his career in research governance and is now a clinical project manager. In addition, he is also a freelance columnist and mentor. Nicol-Wilson began advocating for sickle cell anemia in 2018 through various talks, columns, and community outreach. He hopes his advocacy will raise awareness for sickle cell and blood donation, encouraging others to share their stories. Outside of work and advocacy, he loves to travel, try new experiences, and spend time with friends and family."</p>

        <p>"Dana Marton is a mom, a wife, a daughter, a belly dancer, a blogger, a children's ministries teacher, a dance teacher, and a support group leader. She was diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis in 2002. It took a few years to get a doctor to finally call it ankylosing spondylitis. She didn't give everything up though. She continued to belly dance. And she continues to dance and teach dance, as well as teach chair dance classes to those with pain and to older people. She also leads a support group for those with spondyloarthritis. She hopes that all can help one another by sharing their stories, sharing how everyone copes, and by listening to one another. All have different stories, but all seem to be more alike than different. It can be very wonderful sharing more with one another."  </p>

        <p>"Lyric Porter is a native of Chicago. She was diagnosed with sickle cell disease as a baby during newborn screening. Over the course of her life, she has endured many hospitalizations because of the illness, as well as monthly blood transfusions which caused her to have frequent absences from school. Porter's constant battle with sickle cell disease caused her to miss many days of class during every level of education from elementary school through college. However, she persevered and graduated with a B.S. in Broadcast Journalism from Florida A&M University, with honors from several national organizations. She is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. Porter enjoys encouraging other patients with Sickle Cell Anemia to reach for success and not allow chronic pain to limit their lifestyle." </p>
